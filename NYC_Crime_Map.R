###TO DO:
#FILTER SO ALL DATA IS PROPER CASE/NOT A BROKEN CAPSLOCK.(USE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS TO MAKE SURE SPACES ARE ALL SET)
#HEATMAP OF CRIMES
#CLEAN UP BORO AND CRIME GRAPHS

###STRETCH GOALS:
#reverse look up 
#Alter map color to something nicer
#make it so boro and crime stats are just one tab with an absolute panel on top to pick which one you want/what to focus on
##*ADD ABOUT THE DATA/ABOUT ME PAGE
